This course is taught by Sergey Levine from Berkeley. Lectures are split into multiple parts approximately 10-40 minutes each. My goal going through this course is to get a broad overview of the field of deep reinforcement learning.

## Lecture 1

### Part 1

Why do we care about deep reinforcement learning? What does it allow us to do that we couldn't do before?

- We can learn to do things that we cannot directly label.
- We can learn to generate things that are better or unlike anything we've seen before.

So for example, learning a Chess/Go agent that uses effective strategies that we've never seen before. This isn't really possible through traditional behavior cloning / supervised learning.

Another example is learning to grasp objects with a robotic arm. We can't directly label the actions that the arm should take, so we need to learn through reinforcement learning.
