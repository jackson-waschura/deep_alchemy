Collection of notes and experiments covering Deep RL and related topics.

## Overview

This repository contains my notes and experiments related to Deep Reinforcement Learning. My goal is to quickly get up to speed on the field and then start working on projects.

To begin, I started by going through the "Reinforcement Learning By the Book" videos by the Mutual Information channel on YouTube. These were a great introduction to the notation and concepts of reinforcement learning including a lot of great animated examples. I followed along with the videos by implementing the same blackjack Policy Iteration example.

Next I went through the DeepMind x UCL Reinforcement Learning Lectures from 2021. **Work in progress**.

## Notes

**Courses:**

- [Reinforcement Learning By the Book](notes/rl_by_the_book.md), 5 hours
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning](notes/berkeley_cs285_2023.md), 35 hours
- [DeepMind x UCL Reinforcement Learning Course](notes/deepmind_ucl_2021.md), 20 hours

The Berkeley and DeepMind courses likely overlap a decent amount so I think I should focus first on the DeepMind course then evaluate if I need to go through the Berkeley course.
